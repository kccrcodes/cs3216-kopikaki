Voice-first social concierge for seniors. Uncle calls (or types) what he feels like doing, Gemini understands it, matches him with a real person — falling back to a group or activity if there's no 1:1 match — and confirms a meetup. This demo is scoped to that hero flow:

**call → match (People → Groups → Activities) → confirm → Home → My Kakis**

## Run locally

**Prerequisites:** Node.js 20+, Java 21+, and a `.env` with `GEMINI_API_KEY`.

```powershell
npm install
npm run emulators
```

In a second terminal:

```powershell
npm run seed
npm run dev
```

The first terminal installs dependencies and starts local Firebase emulators (Auth/Firestore), so nothing touches the real cloud project while developing. The second seeds that local database with test data and starts the Next.js dev server.

Open `http://localhost:3000` — the browser signs in as the seeded emulator user, David Tan. Firestore Emulator UI: `http://localhost:4000`.

**On a real phone (same Wi-Fi):** run `npm run dev:https`, accept the local certificate on the phone, then open the computer's LAN address on port 3000. HTTPS is required for microphone/PWA access on mobile; emulator clients pick it up from the page hostname automatically.

## Checks

```powershell
npm run check:matcher
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run build
```

`check:matcher` fails if the People → Groups → Activities fallback contract changes — it guards the one piece of logic the whole demo depends on.

## Shared demo deployment

Firebase App Hosting deploys this Next.js app from `main`. The Firebase Web App values are saved in the App Hosting backend's **Settings → Environment** page, not committed to this repo:

```text
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
```

`GEMINI_API_KEY` is a Cloud Secret Manager secret referenced by `apphosting.yaml`. Create it once with `firebase apphosting:secrets:set GEMINI_API_KEY --project kopikakis-cc6d5`, then trigger a rollout. Do not add it to App Hosting's plaintext environment form or commit it.

## Staged / dropped from v1

Real phone OTP and Firebase App Hosting need a real Firebase project on the Blaze plan — staged after the seeded hero flow works. Dropped for v1: SOS/trusted contacts, onboarding carousel, accessibility settings, notifications, profiles, activity browsing, group chat.

## Stack

Next.js (App Router, TypeScript) · Firebase (Auth, Firestore) · Gemini (Live for voice, Flash for matching) — one Google project end-to-end, deployed via Firebase App Hosting.
